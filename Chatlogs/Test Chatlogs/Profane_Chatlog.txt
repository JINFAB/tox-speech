[12:03 AM] Mikha: Where the fuck have you been, Gab? I’ve been trying to reach you all night!
[12:04 AM] Gab: Calm down, I was just out with the guys. What’s the big deal?
[12:05 AM] Mikha: The big deal? You were at the club, weren’t you? You didn’t even tell me!
[12:06 AM] Gab: So what if I was? I don’t need to report every little thing to you. bitch.
[12:07 AM] Mikha: oh fuck you, Gab. You’re so selfish! You know how much that bothers me, and you still did it!
[12:08 AM] Gab: fuck off my case, Mikha. Maybe if you weren’t such a bitch, I wouldn’t have to hide things from you!
[12:09 AM] Mikha: Controlling? I just want some respect! But you’re just a lying dickhead!
[12:10 AM] Gab: Oh, I’m the liar? You’re the one who’s always fucking paranoid. Maybe that’s why no one can stand you!
[12:11 AM] Mikha: piece of shit! I’m paranoid because you keep fucking lying to me! You’re a dickhead and I’m done with your shit!
[12:12 AM] Gab: Good, leave then! I’m sick of your fucking drama anyways. You’re a bitch who makes everything worse!
[12:13 AM] Mikha: Fine! I don’t need this shit from a dickhead like you. You’re dead to me.
[12:14 AM] Gab: Whatever, bitch. You were never worth it anyway.
