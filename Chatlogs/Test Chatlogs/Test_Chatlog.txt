[10:16 AM] Angelo: I'm good, thanks! You?
[10:17 AM] Sans: I'm fine, but seriously, you're so annoying. Just leave me alone.
[10:18 AM] Angelo: What's your problem? You're acting like a jerk.
[10:19 AM] Sans: Because you never shut up. You're the worst.
[10:20 AM] Angelo: Wow, that's really hurtful. I don't know why you're being like this.
[10:21 AM] Sans: I don't care. Just get lost and stop talking to me.
