[09:05 AM] Tyrone: GG, man. You almost clutched that round!
[09:06 AM] CJ: LOL, yeah right. You were just camping like a scrub.
[09:07 AM] Tyrone: Lmao, coming from the guy who whiffed every shot. Nice aim, bro.
[09:08 AM] CJ: Whatever, Tyrone. You’re just a rat who hides in corners.
[09:09 AM] Tyrone: Rat? At least I don’t need to rely on lucky sprays to get kills.
[09:10 AM] CJ: Says the guy who kept flashing his own team. Pathetic.
[09:11 AM] Tyrone: Flashbangs? Your whole team was clueless. You’re just a walking L.
[09:12 AM] CJ: Better than being a no-skill tryhard. Your plays were all trash.
[09:13 AM] Tyrone: Trash? You were feeding kills. Face it, you’re just a bot.
[09:14 AM] CJ: Bot? You’re the one with the worst stats. You’re just a carry-seeking noob.
[09:15 AM] Tyrone: Noob? You’re a cringe player who can’t even hold a site.
[09:16 AM] CJ: Cringe? Your game sense is so bad, it’s embarrassing.
[09:17 AM] Tyrone: Embarrassing? I’m not the one whiffing every important shot.
[09:18 AM] CJ: Shots? You missed more than you hit. You’re just a wannabe pro.
[09:19 AM] Tyrone: Wannabe? Your gameplay is so basic, it’s laughable.
[09:20 AM] CJ: Laughable? You’re a total bot. You wouldn’t survive in a real match.
[09:21 AM] Tyrone: Real match? You wouldn’t even make it past bronze.
[09:22 AM] CJ: Bronze? At least I’m not a toxic fool who can’t handle criticism.
[09:23 AM] Tyrone: Criticism? You’re just a whiny baby who can’t accept that you suck.
[09:24 AM] CJ: Whatever. I’m done dealing with your trash talk.
[09:25 AM] Tyrone: Good. I’m sick of your garbage excuses anyway.
